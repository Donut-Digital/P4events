Hire some arcade games and make sure your guests or staff have a memorable day. The retro arcade games have always been the most popular, even today. A lot of the classics have inspired the modern games, but the great thing about them is that they are still fun to play and let everybody enjoy some nostalgia. Whether you are planning a launch event. Christmas party, networking event or just rewarding your staff with something special, arcade machines are definitely the way to go for some entertainment."

But, décor and branding also play\_a big part too. With custom branded arcade machines, you can combine entertainment with advertising and make sure that the machine matches your theme or venue. We brand your machine to match your company colours and incorporate your logo, to really stand out and get people talking. It’s also great to share on social media to promote how great your event was…and it’s likely the guests will do that too!"

It was definitely a success that helped promote Snapchat.'
