But lots â€“ and lots â€“ of couples tell me that they donâ€™t follow a faith but that they consider themselves spiritual. This doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that they are anti-religion â€“ but just that a church ceremony isnâ€™t really their thing. So, they wind up getting the registrar out to the venue, and they swap 1 â€˜one size fits allâ€™ script for another, slightly different, â€˜one size fits all scriptâ€™.'

Iâ€™ll help you with this, so no panicking required.'

Itâ€™s just about separating the 2 bits of getting married â€“ liken it to registering a babyâ€™s birth â€“ the date on the birth certificate is never the date the bay was born â€“ same principle exactly â€“ QED ðŸ™‚ â€“ I like these little Latin thingies, they sure are useful at times when we donâ€™t have a handy sort of phrase about.'
