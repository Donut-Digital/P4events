    title: 'On the Day Support'
    introduction: 'We understand that many couples will wish to plan their wedding their own way, without the input of a wedding planner, but why not let someone else assist you in ensuring those plans are executed to perfection on the day? Giving you complete peace of mind, and allowing you to truly enjoy your special day without any hitches.'
