            text: 'Exhibition Use – in todays world of exhibitions, every metre of space is precious (and expensive), so it’s crucial to ensure you maximise your space and make it as visually interesting as possible to drive the maximum amount of visitors to your stand and in turn convert these to maximise your ROI. Not only is Esports on trend, it’s also extremely interactive and life-like in comparison to one of our traditional Sega Rally One arcade machines for instance. The added benefit of the podium is that it raises up the simulator, making it more visual and provides you with a blank canvas to ensure you get your message across and noticed.'

Well why not hire our ESports simulator and put his driving skills to the test. We can arrive at your office / workplace and be set-up within one hour and as the simulator breaks down we can fit in to even the tightest of spaces. Once you’ve tested the boss’ ability it’s the staffs turn to race against the clock and see who can beat the top score on race tracks around the world. We even have the latest Platinum headsets, so if it’s in an office environment only the gamer can hear the action without distracting other staff.'
