            text: "The Financial Reporter Industry Awards, first launched in 2009 and has made a name for itself as the most transparent (and coveted!) awards programme in the industry.\_Developed to support a changing industry by promoting good practice, the prestigious Financial Reporter Awards provide an incentive for firms to go above and beyond, and be rewarded for it by those who know best – the intermediaries. The Financial Reporter readers then vote for any candidate they see fit, without a panel or short-list, means that these awards truly represent the industry’s opinion on who deserves to be recognised.\_The programme spans a wide range of sectors, offering categories for mortgages, secured loans, commercial and bridging finance, insurance, debt solutions, technology and legal."
