            text: 'From an initial consultation at their home in Leeds, we worked closely with the couple, to recognise and work to their exacting specifications. Taking inspiration from the country estate, we created a warm and homely rustic feel using tones of cream and duck egg blue. Including 8ft trees, herb boxes on arrival and country garden inspired centre pieces to perfect the look.'

We had a vision in our mind, and you took that vision to a new level with your creativity, attention to detail, fabulous business partners, great taste & passion. You allowed us to have an incredibly high quality wedding within the budget we had, but more than that, you made the entire day run seamlessly and took all possible pressure & stress out of all the work that goes in to planning a wedding!”'
