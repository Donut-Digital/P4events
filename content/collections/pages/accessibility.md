Wherever possible, links are written to make sense out of context. Many browsers (such as JAWS, Home Page Reader, Lynx and Opera) can extract the list of links on a page and allow you to browse the links separately from the page.'

Tables are used for tabular data, but we have avoided using them to dictate the layout of a page wherever possible.\_The stylesheet uses relative font sizes and is written to display pages correctly in most commonly-used browsers. In early versions of browsers and browsing devices that do not support stylesheets at all, the flow of the content has been tested to ensure it entirely retains its sense."
