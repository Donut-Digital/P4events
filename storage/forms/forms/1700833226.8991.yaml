event_description: "We are hosting a charity ball at Barton manor on the 23rd March 2024 to raise money for St Catherine's Hospice. We decided to do this as we recently lost somebody very close to us due to a cancerous brain tumour and lung cancer. Our loved one spent her final few weeks in St Catherine's Hospice. We couldn't thank them enough for all they did not just for our loved one but also to our whole family. \r\n\r\nWe're looking for someone to help decorate the room for us, is this something you could be interested in helping us out with?  I've had a look through your website and you look incredible at what you do. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hopefully hearing back from you. \r\n\r\nKind Reagrds, \r\nMadison Critchley."
