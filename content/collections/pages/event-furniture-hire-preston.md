We specialise in Marquee weddings and events so when it comes to transforming an empty venue, we know a thing or two! It’s always going to be friendlier on your budget to minimise the number of hire suppliers where possible and as P4 Events has access to bar and booth layouts, bean bags and tables to props and accessories, you’ll be able to hire everything you need from one place so there’s no need to coordinate with many different suppliers.'
