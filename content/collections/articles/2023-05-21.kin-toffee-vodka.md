Kin is a rich, blend of caramel, vanilla and toffee flavours which are hosted by a British distilled vodka, with the delicious toffee being the leading flavour. It has an abv of 20.3% which mean that it is a beautiful drink in its own right, not necessarily needing to be mixed.\_ It is gluten, dairy free, GMO free and vegan."

            text: "The inspiration to develop this drink came from years skiing in the French Alps, where versions of Toffee Vodka are very popular. Once I had tasted it there was no going back! I came home and made my own version which I gave to friends and family for presents and just to enjoy, for over 6 years….lucky them!\_ I first thought about make a small business from the product when working for a children’s’ charity and as staff we were doing some fundraising. So, I took in my sticky toffee puddings and my newly discovered toffee vodka and it went down a storm – I had orders coming out of my ears, so it got me thinking that there may be a business here. From there I did all the regulation stuff and in December 2013 we produced our first bottles."

The older age groups enjoy it as a straight drink, chilled or as a cocktail eg Kir Royal in prosecco / champagne or just a warming treat.\_ We have therefore a very wide appeal across all age ranges."
