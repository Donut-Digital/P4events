Over 74% of events in the UK have been “postponed” and the rest cancelled for the duration of 2020. Now people outside of our industry may say well surly that’s a good thing, at least the majority are only “postponed”, but we know as an industry that “postponed” may as well be a cancellation in many instances such as a loss of a full years revenue from an annual event who’s “postponing to 2021” or a new date later in the year which now cancels out that date for new business and fresh revenue.'

These are the three things I hold close to my heart in my business and always have from the very beginning.'

            text: 'Once the bulk of the work had been carried out and a plan put in place to secure our position moving forward, I took a little “time out”. We all say sometimes I wish I could just press pause and take a minute to breath, and that was exactly what that moment felt like to me. I knew the business was in a safe place and I spent an entire week working on the landscaping of the new home we’d moved in to in December just before Christmas and barely had a moment to take it all in let alone enjoy it. I left my devices upstairs and apart from checking in on the evenings it really did feel like a true pause for the first time in 14 years.'

That fancy car that was sat on the drive for months costing a small fortune and the designer gear tucked away in its dust bags as there was nowhere to go out and wear it. The real value in our lives comes in my next and final point.'

            text: 'Family, Friends and the ones we love – earlier this year we had the #BeKind campaign and the moments of silence before shows to “get people talking“, but let’s be honest, did anyone really speak during that split second of silence? In reality the majority of us picked up their devices and had another quick scroll or check of the emails before the show came on. COVID-19 has shown us how much the people we love in our life mean to us, how much we miss them when we can’t just pop round to give them a big hug. It’s also got families talking (ok and maybe a few arguments), which for most has probably helped understand each other better, learn from our mistakes and gain back that true quality time we normally only ever really think about when that time has gone and we’ve missed the opportunity.'

Put value on the “real” things that matter in life, continue to enjoy nature for all the beauty it beholds, and most of all continue to talk, work together and spend that quality time whilst we still have it to savour.'
