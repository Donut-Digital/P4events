    title: 'Event Theming'
    introduction: 'From recreating an Ibiza beach party complete with white loungers, live sax and a Tiki bar, to looking back through the decades and reliving that childhood nostalgia with a retro gaming theme complete with old school arcade games like Defender and Space invaders paired with our cool giant Rubix cubes tables, Tetris chairs and PacMan seating. Whatever takes your fancy, your wish is our command.'
