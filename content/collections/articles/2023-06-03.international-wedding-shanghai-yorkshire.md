summary: 'The story of the international wedding of Wayne and Cindy which we recently managed at the beautiful Carlton Towers in Yorkshire is going to take us way back, that far back in fact that the story begins before P4 Events was even incorporated.'

            text: 'For those of you who don’t know, my career path started out in a very different direction when I started at Myerscough college in 2002 embarking on a National Diploma in motorsport. I’ve always had a passion for cars and racing and my dream at that stage of my life was to work in the motorsport industry, managing the logistics of racing teams and the glamorous hospitality that sits alongside the track. At Myerscough was where I met Wayne and together we planned my very first event, a modified car show in 2004.'

To fill you in on the ‘better half’ (Wayne won’t thank me for that). Cindy is a fashion designer who studied at F.I.T in New York before going on to work for Alexander McQueen and finally setting up her own fashion brand in Shanghai which now has 29 concessions and a flagship store opening this year, along with offices in Beijing and New York.'

            text: 'So as you can imagine planning a wedding from over 5,500 miles away was always going to be a challenge and that’s when it’s handy to have a best man who’s also a wedding planner! As I’m used to working on mainly marquee events or at large scale corporate venues, we googled the top 10 wedding venues and with so many guests flying in from all over the world the only main requirement was to be near a major airport. After much research we decided on Carlton Towers and luckily they had a Saturday free which also tied in with the lunar calendar which was important to Cindy and Chinese traditions.'

A virtual tour was created of the venue to send over to Wayne and Cindy as the venues wedding planner showed me around the grand state rooms and extremely impressive Baroness Tower Bridal Suite and with that the venue was booked.'

This started the wedding weekend on a high with everyone getting to know each other and enjoying a traditional Yorkshire dish of bangers and mash reared on the Carlton Towers estate before the girls headed off with our make up artist Natalie for a spot of pampering.'
